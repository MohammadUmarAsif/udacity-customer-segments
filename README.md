# Udacity Project: Creating Customer Segments with Arvato
## Nanodegree (Intro to Machine Learning with Pytorch)

### Description
Udacity project to identify customer segments using clustering & PCA for a mail-order sales company. Clusters of the German population are generated and matched with the existing customers of the company to aid in digital marketing campaigns.

### Steps Performed -
1. Loading & exploration of data.
2. Assessment of missing data in rows & columns.
3. Removal of certain rows & columns.
4. Re-encoding of categorical features.
5. Engineering of new features.
6. Feature Scaling, PCA, and PCA interpretation.
7. Clustering using KMeans on general population & customers.
8. Comparison of data clusters from both datasets.
9. Identification of segments with over/under representation of customers.
10. Visualization of clusters and demographics.

### Install
This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

Also requires a software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Files
This project contains three files:

- `identifying_customer_segments.ipynb`: Main file with my implementation.
- `report.html`: HTML file of the ipynb notebook.

### Run
Run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook identifying_customer_segments.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook identifying_customer_segments.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data
Data on the German population by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics. Cannot share the csv files.
